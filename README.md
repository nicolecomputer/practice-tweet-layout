# Tweet Layout

![3 tweets with lorem-ipsum text](screenshot.png)

This is a quick warmup for laying out a tweet component, matching the style of
Twitter.com.

## Getting Started

This app uses [vite](http://vite.dev/guide/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), and
deploys as a static site.

- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev` to start the project with hot reloading

## Deployment

This app is most easily deployed to [heroku](http://heroku.com)-like
environment, like [dokku](http://dokku.com)

## Changes / Pull Request

This app was built as a warmup / practice exercise. It is not open for
pull-request or changes. I hope the code is useful as a reference or
inspiration.
